    This is an actual interview algorithm given to a Coding Dojo alum

    Find Consecutive Sums

    You are given arr, a list of positive integers 0-255
    You are given k, a integer between 1-255

    Find all the consecutive groups of integers that add up to the value k
*/

// inputs:
k = 16
arr = [2, 5, 3, 6, 7, 0, 0, 23, 11]

output = [
    [2, 5, 3, 6],
    [3, 6, 7], //  3, 6, 7 appear consecutively, so they are included in the solution
    [3, 6, 7, 0],
    [3, 6, 7, 0, 0]
]

// create new arrays
// if no matches, return empty array
